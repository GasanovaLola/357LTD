                                        <p> Mark Twain, also known as Samuel Clemens, was an American author and humorist who lived in the 19th century. He is best known for his iconic works, such as "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" and "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," which are both beloved classics of American literature. <br><br>

                                            "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" is a novel published in 1876 and follows the mischievous young protagonist Tom Sawyer as he navigates his small town along the Mississippi River. The story is filled with youthful adventures, pranks, and the exploration of themes such as friendship, morality, and the loss of innocence. <br><br>
                                            
                                            "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," published in 1884, is considered one of Twain's greatest works and a masterpiece of American literature. The novel chronicles the escapades of the young Huck Finn as he embarks on a journey down the Mississippi River, accompanied by the escaped slave Jim. Through their adventures, the novel tackles themes of racism, social injustice, and the search for freedom and personal identity. <br><br>
                                            
                                            Both of these books by Mark Twain are celebrated for their vivid characterizations, authentic dialogue, and their depiction of the American experience during the 19th century. Twain's writing style is known for its wit, satire, and keen observation of human nature. <br><br>
                                            
                                            While "The Adventure" is not a recognized work by Mark Twain, his existing body of literature has left an indelible mark on American literature and continues to be celebrated for its humor, social commentary, and enduring themes.</p>
